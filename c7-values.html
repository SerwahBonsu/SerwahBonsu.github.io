  <p>In general, I try to live up to these values: Coolness Under Fire. Accountability. Grit.</p>

  <p><b>My Values</b></p>

  <p>Grit is the value I try to live by the most. An unforgettable New York Times piece, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/magazine/what-if-the-secret-to-success-is-failure.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">What if the Secret to Success is Failure?</a></li> describes grit as "a passion for a single mission with an unswerving dedication to achieve that mission, whatever the obstacles and however long it might take." When I think of grit, I think of my mother who left everything in her hometown of Ghana to set out for a brighter future in America. I also think of embracing the possibility of failure and creating contingency plans. Indeed, the article goes on to cite a resonating point by Dominic Randolph a headmaster of Riverdal Country School, “The idea of building grit and building self-control is that you get that through failure.”</p>

  <p><b>Advice and Accountability</b></p>

  <p>The last time someone asked me for advice, it was regarding an <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/why-i-learned-to-code">article</a> a friend of mine had written for Modern View Culture on the importance of learning how to code. She was in the draft phase and had wanted my feedback. The advice she sought from me reminded me about my value of accountability and how I hold myself and others to a standards regarding feminism, racial justice and other concepts that I work towards and anti-oppression work. It was rewarding to discuss this in the context of code -- something to which I am so dedicated.</p>

  <p><b>Vision as Resistance</b></p>

  <p>Remembering one's values seem like a great strategy when thinking of ways to cultivate internal strength. While I don't believe that individual exercises can combat systems of oppression, I do believe in tapping into my own agency and need to survive difficult circumstances. And so I believe in closing my eyes and focusing on the destination in times of indecision and strife as opposed to the difficulties of the journey. Hopefully with this outlook I will arrive -- victorious! </p>
