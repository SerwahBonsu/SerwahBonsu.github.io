  <h2>On Coding Challenges -- No Boots, Not Those</h2>

  <h3>Date 10/26/14</h3>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="https://d2c796fw38dva6.cloudfront.net/assets/ruby-382e6fc56266197ea526f5af51147bdc.png" />
  </div>
    <p>Coding is a struggle. While I concede that it is totally learnable, external factors often have to be managed to facilitate a meaningful learning experience. The biggest challenge for me has been climbing the learning curve of Virtual Machines, which was the best chance I had to get my Windows system to be code-ready. I slowly learned that in the beginning, it can impact the way I download programs essential for programming, whether or not internet connectivity will be seemless, and the overall interface in which I field error messages. I was lucky to have a fellow cohort member mentor me through this process, and feel like I have hit my stride through tons of trial and error and the robust resources on Digital Ocean.</p>
    <p>After firefighting technical challenges, I also had to take some time to think about how my learning style affects the way I retain knowledge. I am a kinesthetic learner meaning I learn by doing. That means that going through repetitive exercises in codecademy or treehouse are much more effective for me to learn than finishing Pine chapters in one sitting. I struggle a lot with applying concepts after I have just read it once or have seen it in a video. I need to <b>do</b>. Do again. And do again. So this poses some time management challenges for me.  </p>
    <p>So, to be successful at DBC, I have had to flex my time management muscles and really be introspective about what helps me produce my best work. I learned a lot from the time management resources DBC personally offers and routinely have a timer tracking the length it takes for me to complete challenges. I have also invested in a co-working space that is affirming to ensure I am not couch-coding (which is a total slow-downer).</p>
    <p>I also have to consciously work on my attitude toward coding. I have had a tendency to view it as this larger than life thing that is as vast as the internet, so vast it <i>feels</i> unlearnable. I also excelled more in writing than math growing up, so sometimes I let that psych me out. I counteract this by reciting affirming poems and sayings on my caffeine runs. I recited this <a href="http://www.values.com/inspirational-quotes/6870-Promise-Yourself-To-Be-So-S-">one</a> 40 times today. I also have to take my thinking style into account. I am a Concrete Random Thinker: I am a brainstormer, self-directed, experimenter. It's most digestible for me to frame things I learn in the context of my own experiences.</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, I try to invoke a saying of a good friend of mine MJ: Always Learning. MJ's credo is consistent with the tenets of a “growth intelligence mindset,” one that seeks challenge and believes that failure is not a proof of unintelligence but an encouraging springboard for growth and development." So I am not beating myself up when I take too long to learn something. I am being proactive and really investing time in tracking how long things take so that next week and the week after -- I have better assessment of how long it is going to take ao I can allocate and cut accordingly.</p> 
    </p>Like, for instance this message was written to you in 30 minutes. How much you want to bet I could get this down to 20 by Phase 1?</p>

<h1> To Array or Hash? -- That is the Question!
  </h1>

  <h2>Applying Hashes and Arrays to What I Do Everyday</h2>

  <h3>Date 10/26/14</h3>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="http://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/collections_arrays.png" />

  </div>
    <p>Arrays and Hashes are really exciting for me. They were the point in my budding programming career when I fell in love with code. The ability to store lots of information and access it is really vital to the work I do everyday. My work in Black youth led justice movements has really been propelled by the ability to put phone numbers in an array and utilize the Twilio API to connect with activists to remind them about a protest or a meeting.</p> 
    <p>Additionally, before I am able to lobby the city to put eligibility requirements for social services in city, state, county open data portals, eligibility requirements for social services are stored in hashes for so they can easily inform people whether they qualify in the app I have been co-developing, <a href="http://www.mrelief.com/">mRelief</a>.</p>
    <p>So, what are these things?</p>
    <h3>Arrays</h3>
    <p> According to Chris Pine's <i>Learn to Program</i> arrays are a list in your computer wherein every slot in the list acts like a variable and you can see what object a particular slot points to. This great when you want to store things in a numerical order. The process of arrays usually start with assigning them to a variable You could also start out with an empty array and assign a slot. Here is an example I came up with on the fly:</p>
    <xmp>
  fyne_ass_rappers = [ ]
  fyne_ass_rappers [0] = Wale 
  fyne_ass_rappers [1] = Mack Wilds
  </xmp>
  <p>I could go on to list these until I came up with the top rappers for 2014. Other important things to call out about arrays, they start at 0, not 1 in terms of how they order information.</p>
  <h3>Hashes</h3>
  <p>Hashes, are defined at codecademy.com as a collection of key-value pairs. Hash syntax, code-speak for punctuation, looks like this:</p>
  <xmp>
    hash = {
  key1 => value1,
    key2 => value2,
    key3 => value3
  }
  </xmp>
  <p>
  Essentially, hashes are used to store pieces of information that wouldn't intuitively be listed in numerical order. This is just a brief post to get this concept across. As I continue to jot down my process coming into software development, I hope to delve even further with these concepts.

      <h1>CSS: Classes vs. IDs</h1>
      <p>10/26/14</p>
      <h3>What are the best CSS practices associated with using classes vs. IDs?</h3>
      <p>What is CSS?</p>

<p>Let’s talk Cascading Style Sheets - CSS. CSS, according, to <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy</a> is a language used to describe the appearance and formatting of your HTML. 
CSS is important because it allows you to style your website in a more efficient way and with a sheet that can be applied to multiple different web pages.
</p>

<h4>Two CSS Selectors: ID and Class</h4>
<p>Classes come in handy  when you have a bunch of elements that should all receive the same styling. Classes are given to HTML elements with the word class and an equals sign, like so:</p>
<xmp>
<div class="square"></div>
</xmp>

<p>Classes are identified in CSS with a dot (.) like this.
IDs are useful when you have exactly one element that should receive a certain kind of styling. IDs are given to HTML elements with the word id and an equals sign:
</p>

<xmp>
<div id="first"></div>
</xmp>

<p>IDs are identified in CSS with a pound sign (#):
An <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/970730/css-id-vs-class">article</a> on stackoverflow makes this analogy about classes vs. ids to help understand which is used for one instance of something in an html document vs. many:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ID = Student ID (Schools don't issue identical IDs to multiple students)</li>
  <li>CLASS = Group of Students (Like 'The Biology Class' will be going on a fieldtrip)</li>
</ul>

<p>Happy CSSing!</p>

<h1> The Culture of Dev BootCamp </h1>

  <h2>On Jumping off the Code Cliff</h2>

<p>10/20/14</p>

<p>Accountability. Ownership. Passion. These are the first words that comes to mind when I think about DBC and listen to the fireside chat. Accountability -- because DBC truly creates a space of accountability and checking in from GPS sessions to weekly deadlines. Ownership -- because what I learn depends on me. Passion because I can't jump off this cliff and have the grit to push through to the end unless I am really passionate about what being developer will help me create in the world.</p> 

<p>So far, I am really, really overwhelmed -- but in a good way. I definitely feel like I have jumped off of a cliff in trying to learn what feels so intricate and complex -- especially doing so on a Windows machine which has unexpected glitches.</p>

<p>DBC feels very thorough. I have had my share of higher education, this is the first place where I have studied where I have a good grasp of how I best learn and what I want my learning to apply to. And for that I am very grateful.</p>

<p>As far as the DBC culture, I feel like I am totally a cook in the code kitchen. I am not going to be a passive consumer of code. But at the same time, I am wondering how to manage competing interests -- my startup and learning how to code effectively. I believe that I have what it takes to perservere and to identify what I need to be successful in the educational arena and the startup arena.</p>

<p>I am grateful to be on this journey!</p>

      <h1>Giddy About Github?</h1>
      <p> Date 10/19/14</p>
      
<h3>Week 1 of DBC illuminates Github</h3>

<p>Git can be compared to an old school digital rolodex where you store information. Only instead of storing info on your friends that information is code.  It lives in a finite place, say, on your computer and you can make additions to the rolodex if someone changed their name. </p>

<p>Github, not to be confused with Git, takes this to the next level. It would be like if your rolodex was instead live on the web, where you and friends could contribute. It is similar to how Google+ and Gmail work together to update your contacts -- both by your contributions and by your contacts themselves.
</p>

<p>What's more is that both and Github work together to produce the brilliance that is version control. Version control is solving for a problem that often happens when one works on content: losing changes. Github helps with this because it is a central platform where as many as hundreds of collaborators who are working together can manage the different versions of their project.
</p> 

<p>What does this look like in real time?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Usually this will involve a step like pushing to a branch (almost like sharing a draft with friends before sharing the final copy)</li>
  <li>Then you will do a pull request to ensure that someone ( a teammate or superior) can approve their changes before integrating them into the final document. </li> 
  <li>Then the last step is to merge the changes into the master branch (or final document)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cool stuff, huh? Go and Git you some!</p>

      <p> "Promise yourself to be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind. Look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true. Think only of the best, work only for the best, and expect only the best. Forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future. Give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to criticize others. Live in the faith that the whole world is on your side so long as you are true to the best that is in you!" - Christian D. Larson
