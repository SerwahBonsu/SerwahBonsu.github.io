  <h1>Enumerable Methods</h1>

  <h2>A Brief post on Map! an Why It Matters</h2>

  </div>
    <p>Enumerable methods are defined in <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.4/Enumerable.html">Ruby Docs</a> as "a mixin provides collection classes with several traversal and searching methods, and with the ability to sort." Rubyist Robert Quails <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/guide-ruby-collections-iii-enumerable-enumerator/">discusses a mixin</a> as follows:
    <blockquote>
     In most languages, code sharing is only possible through inheritance, and inheritance is generally limited to one parent class. In addition to classes, Ruby has modules which are containers for methods and constants. If you want to write code once and share it between a bunch of unrelated classes, you can put it in modules to be “mixed in” with your classes. 
     </blockquote></p> 
    <p> In a recent exercise at Dev Bootcamp I reviewed one enumerable method called map!. map! is a destructive method that takes an enumerable object for each element, in this case an element of an array, and replaces the element with the value returned from the block. Check out how I used it here: </p>

  <xmp>
  def my_array_modification_method(source, thing_to_modify)
  source.map! do |x|
    (x.is_a?(Integer)) ? x + thing_to_modify : x
  end
  </xmp>

  <p>In the above example I used map! to check and see whether integers were in an array. If they were, the method above enables me to add some number to those integers and change the original array. It's a concept that I hope to explore more but it is definitely a useful one when you want to look through a list of items.</p>

  <h1>The Key To Inclusive Software Solutions</h1>

  <h2>Why learning entrepreneurship is just as important as learning how to code</h2>

  <h3>11/2/14</h3>
  <div class="center">

  </div>
    <p>In the contemporary digital era, there is a huge push for learning how to code. Large tech companies are increasingly investing in women and people of color to learn programming languages. Yet, learning how to code is only half of the equation if we want to have software solutions applied to challenges that affect low-income people and underrepresented groups. Another critical investment we must make is in equipping women and people of color with the skills needed to be entrepreneurs.</p> 
    <p> The founding members of any startup will ultimately line the rank of officer positions and higher level management. Priorities for any tech company -- which are mostly top-down -- are often set by these decision makers. This includes calls about whether to take up challenges for lower-income groups and these decisions are often not made by diverse teams. </p> <p><a href="http://pushinteractions.collegemobileinc.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/cult-of-mac-money-hd.jpg">Data crunched</a> on 20 Tech companies in 2013, was very revealing about this dearth of diverse decision makers. A look at 5 large tech companies shows no woman in an officer or high level management role at 3 out of 5 companies -- the remaining 2 had none. For African Americans there were no more than 4 in this same category with two companies having none.</p>
    <p>Some encouraging models in this arena include <a href="http://bushjob01.chicagobooth.edu/Facultycourse08/CourseProfDetaila.aspx?course_ns=36110&section_id=65034&ac_year=2014&selAcademicYear=2014&src=FacultyDetail2.aspx">recent attempts</a> by Business Schools to teach web development. This is important because business schools are traditionally more diverse than medicine and law programs allowing for some ground to be gained. Inversely, however, coding schools should also be more overt about offering skills on sustaining a startup. This can be achieved by creating stronger bonds with accelerators. In this way, they provide students with curriculum that equips them to be as efficient with code as they are with budgets, plans to establish private and public partnerships and overall management.</p>
    <p>This is how we build inclusive software solutions of the future. </p>

  <h2>On Coding Challenges -- No Boots, Not Those</h2>

  <h3>Date 10/26/14</h3>
  <div class="center">

    <p>Coding is a struggle. While I concede that it is totally learnable, external factors often have to be managed to facilitate a meaningful learning experience. The biggest challenge for me has been climbing the learning curve of Virtual Machines, which was the best chance I had to get my Windows system to be code-ready. I slowly learned that in the beginning, it can impact the way I download programs essential for programming, whether or not internet connectivity will be seemless, and the overall interface in which I field error messages. I was lucky to have a fellow cohort member mentor me through this process, and feel like I have hit my stride through tons of trial and error and the robust resources on Digital Ocean.</p>
    <p>After firefighting technical challenges, I also had to take some time to think about how my learning style affects the way I retain knowledge. I am a kinesthetic learner meaning I learn by doing. That means that going through repetitive exercises in codecademy or treehouse are much more effective for me to learn than finishing Pine chapters in one sitting. I struggle a lot with applying concepts after I have just read it once or have seen it in a video. I need to <b>do</b>. Do again. And do again. So this poses some time management challenges for me.  </p>
    <p>So, to be successful at DBC, I have had to flex my time management muscles and really be introspective about what helps me produce my best work. I learned a lot from the time management resources DBC personally offers and routinely have a timer tracking the length it takes for me to complete challenges. I have also invested in a co-working space that is affirming to ensure I am not couch-coding (which is a total slow-downer).</p>
    <p>I also have to consciously work on my attitude toward coding. I have had a tendency to view it as this larger than life thing that is as vast as the internet, so vast it <i>feels</i> unlearnable. I also excelled more in writing than math growing up, so sometimes I let that psych me out. I counteract this by reciting affirming poems and sayings on my caffeine runs. I recited this <a href="http://www.values.com/inspirational-quotes/6870-Promise-Yourself-To-Be-So-S-">one</a> 40 times today. I also have to take my thinking style into account. I am a Concrete Random Thinker: I am a brainstormer, self-directed, experimenter. It's most digestible for me to frame things I learn in the context of my own experiences.</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, I try to invoke a saying of a good friend of mine MJ: Always Learning. MJ's credo is consistent with the tenets of a “growth intelligence mindset,” one that seeks challenge and believes that failure is not a proof of unintelligence but an encouraging springboard for growth and development." So I am not beating myself up when I take too long to learn something. I am being proactive and really investing time in tracking how long things take so that next week and the week after -- I have better assessment of how long it is going to take ao I can allocate and cut accordingly.</p> 
    </p>Like, for instance this message was written to you in 30 minutes. How much you want to bet I could get this down to 20 by Phase 1?</p>

      <p> "Promise yourself to be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind. Look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true. Think only of the best, work only for the best, and expect only the best. Forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future. Give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to criticize others. Live in the faith that the whole world is on your side so long as you are true to the best that is in you!" - Christian D. Larson
