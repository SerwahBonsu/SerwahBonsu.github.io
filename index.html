  <h2>On Coding Challenges -- No Boots, Not Those</h2>

    <p>Coding is a struggle. While I concede that it is totally learnable, external factors often have to be managed to facilitate a meaningful learning experience. The biggest challenge for me has been climbing the learning curve of Virtual Machines, which was the best chance I had to get my Windows system to be code-ready. I slowly learned that in the beginning, it can impact the way I download programs essential for programming, whether or not internet connectivity will be seemless, and the overall interface in which I field error messages. I was lucky to have a fellow cohort member mentor me through this process, and feel like I have hit my stride through tons of trial and error and the robust resources on Digital Ocean.</p>
    <p>After firefighting technical challenges, I also had to take some time to think about how my learning style affects the way I retain knowledge. I am a kinesthetic learner meaning I learn by doing. That means that going through repetitive exercises in codecademy or treehouse are much more effective for me to learn than finishing Pine chapters in one sitting. I struggle a lot with applying concepts after I have just read it once or have seen it in a video. I need to <b>do</b>. Do again. And do again. So this poses some time management challenges for me.  </p>
    <p>So, to be successful at DBC, I have had to flex my time management muscles and really be introspective about what helps me produce my best work. I learned a lot from the time management resources DBC personally offers and routinely have a timer tracking the length it takes for me to complete challenges. I have also invested in a co-working space that is affirming to ensure I am not couch-coding (which is a total slow-downer).</p>
    <p>I also have to consciously work on my attitude toward coding. I have had a tendency to view it as this larger than life thing that is as vast as the internet, so vast it <i>feels</i> unlearnable. I also excelled more in writing than math growing up, so sometimes I let that psych me out. I counteract this by reciting affirming poems and sayings on my caffeine runs. I recited this <a href="http://www.values.com/inspirational-quotes/6870-Promise-Yourself-To-Be-So-S-">one</a> 40 times today. I also have to take my thinking style into account. I am a Concrete Random Thinker: I am a brainstormer, self-directed, experimenter. It's most digestible for me to frame things I learn in the context of my own experiences.</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, I try to invoke a saying of a good friend of mine MJ: Always Learning. MJ's credo is consistent with the tenets of a “growth intelligence mindset,” one that seeks challenge and believes that failure is not a proof of unintelligence but an encouraging springboard for growth and development." So I am not beating myself up when I take too long to learn something. I am being proactive and really investing time in tracking how long things take so that next week and the week after -- I have better assessment of how long it is going to take ao I can allocate and cut accordingly.</p> 
    </p>Like, for instance this message was written to you in 30 minutes. How much you want to bet I could get this down to 20 by Phase 1?</p>

      <p> "Promise yourself to be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind. Look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true. Think only of the best, work only for the best, and expect only the best. Forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future. Give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to criticize others. Live in the faith that the whole world is on your side so long as you are true to the best that is in you!" - Christian D. Larson
