  <h1>Stereotype Threat Triggers</h1>

  <h2>What I learned from Malcolm X about Overcoming Stereotype Threat in Coding</h2>

  <p> When I think about <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">stereotype threat</a>, being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group, I think of the things that trigger these moments of self-doubt for people of color. Perhaps the most unforgettable display of such a trigger can be seen in the Autobiography of Malcolm X:</p>

  <blockquote>
      <p>He told me, "Malcolm, you ought to be thinking about a career. Have you
      been giving it thought?"</p>
      <p>The truth is, I hadn&rsquo;t. I never have figured out why I told him, "Well, yes,
      sir, I've been thinking I'd like to be a lawyer." Lansing certainly had no
      lawyers&mdash;or doctors either&mdash;in those days, to hold up an image I might have
      aspired to. All I really knew for certain was that a lawyer didn&rsquo;t wash dishes, as
      I was doing.<p>
      <p>Mr. Ostrowski looked surprised, I remember, and leaned back in his chair
      and clasped his hands behind his head. He kind of half-smiled and said,
      "Malcolm, one of life&rsquo;s first needs is for us to be realistic. Don't misunderstand
      me, now. We all here like you, you know that. But you've got to be realistic
      about being a nigger. A lawyer&mdash;that&rsquo;s no realistic goal for a nigger. You need
      to think about something you can be. You're good with your hands&mdash;making
      things. Everybody admires your carpentry shop work. Why don&rsquo;t you plan on
      carpentry? People like you as a person&mdash;you'd get all kinds of work."
      The more I thought afterwards about what he said, the more uneasy it
      made me. It just kept treading around in my mind...It was then that I began to change&mdash;inside.</p>

</blockquote>
   
    <p>This excerpt highlights an explicit form of racism doled out to Malcolm that, those who have read the book will recall, cast a long shadow on Malcolm's quest for knowledge&mdash;even during his incarceration and a seeming a regret that Malcolm didn't have more options to challenge racism in society, perhaps through his profession. What I also took from this passage is the importance of seeing someone in your community living the dreams that you hold for yourself and the power of spoken affirmation and encouragement to counteract stereotype threat.</p>
    
    <p>Since embarking on the arduous journey that is coding I, too, have been triggered. This past summer, I set out to raise funds to learn how to code. My campaign was gaining momentum and was posted in online forums when my site got hacked.<p>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <p>As seen above, some hackers thought it would be funny to change my picture to that of a fried chicken shack, and swapped out my name with the phrase &rsquoBad Coderrrr&rsquo. I hadn't even built the site myself, but wound up the target of some hacker's ire and the self doubt surely followed. I suspected deeply that I might never amass the know-how to protect my site from hackers and that I might get good at coding after years of practice, but not good enough.</p>

    <p>And then I remembered my community. I reached out to the listserv Systers and they encouraged me with information about grant resources and positive affirmations. I spoke with a close friend of mine Jasson Perez who reminded me that I was competent&mdash;that given instructions and practice I could learn anything and pointed to things that I had learned to do since we started our friendship. And, importantly, I sought refuge in Chicago's Women Developers Network at 1871. Some of the members are self-made women who have seen startups through a successful exit phase and others are women who have been coding for 20 years. They encouraged me to keep learning and talked about what it was like coding in the first 6 months. It helped. </p>

    <p>I am not sure if there is a clear moral to this story. I believe that ending trigeers of stereotype threat require interventions that go well past affirmations and mentorship. But I know that belonging to organizations and established communities are part of the solution when it comes to moral support and the strategic efforts that must be waged to end racism once and for all.</p>
