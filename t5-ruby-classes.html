    <p>According to David A. Black's <i>The Well-Grounded Rubyist,</i> classes are, at heart, a way to organize objects and methods. They simply define groups of behavior and functionality. Some features of a class include:
    <ul>
      <li>they begin with a capital letter</li>
      <li>there are built in classes such as "String" and "Array" etc. </li>
      <li>new classes can be written from scratch; and existing classes can be changed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Another related concept is an instance variable. It helps store information for individual objects. Some features of an instance variable include:<p>
      <ul>
        <li>start with one "@" sign.</li>
        <li>starts with a lower case letter and can also have an underscore, forward slashes </li> 
      </ul>
    
    <p>Another related concept is an instance method which are methods that are shared by all instances of that class. Some features of an instance method include:<p>
      <ul>
        <li>defined inside a class</li>
        <li>intended for use by all methods inside the class</li> </p> 
      </ul>
      <p> Now let's see how this all works together below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <xml>
    class CreditCard
      def initialize(credit_card_number)
      @credit_card_number = credit_card_number
      end
    end
    <xml>
    </blockquote>
    <p> CreditCard is the Class, @credit_card_number is an instance variable. An instance method utilized in this example is initialize, which can be called on every instance of the CreditCard class. This is just a basic preview but something I want to look into more when I get a stronger foundation in Ruby. </p>
