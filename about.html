      <h1>Tech Co-founder. Writer. Learner.</h1>
      <p>
      I am a developer who lives on the South Side of Chicago and project manager of <a href="http://www.mrelief.com/">mRelief</a>, a website and text messaging based app that helps people determine their eligibility for public assistance and local resources. When I am not in a coding cave, I am in a coffee shop writing -- currently on Time Inc.'s payroll. <p> My professional qualifications include an internship at the White House and work experience at Google in marketing and accelerating campaigns of political influencers and nonprofits on Google+. I have a Master in Public Policy from University of Michigan and a BA in Political Science and English Writing Fiction from University of Pittsburgh. I am also an alum of Starter League's Web
      Development Course.</p>
      
     <p>Outside of formal work, I am passionately involved in the work of <a href="http://byp100.org/">BYP100</a> and I sit on the national and local Chicago board focusing on data and membership. Outside of social services and great prose, @mention me on posts about grants, Ghana, and awesome love stories.

      <p> "Promise yourself to be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind. Look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true. Think only of the best, work only for the best, and expect only the best. Forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future. Give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to criticize others. Live in the faith that the whole world is on your side so long as you are true to the best that is in you!" - Christian D. Larson
