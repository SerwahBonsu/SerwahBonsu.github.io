  <p>One main issue I have had with co-founders since launching mRelief is deciding how much we get paid.
One co-founder believed we should get paid equally to reflect our partnership. I believed that my co-founder should be compensated at a rate that is closer to market rates for web developers and that my compensation should be reflective of hitting financial milestones. The argument never descended into the emotional.</p>  

<p>After a few months of one co-founder receiving a higher rate, we compromised on an equal rate for a period of a month to be discussed in the following month. In the interim, we sought advice from similarly situated co-founders and asked how they compensated co-founders before and after achieving financial milestones. They encouraged us to split salaries evenly if we were equally invested in the startup but to always have a savings account for that next hire. We followed suit and are better for this approach to resolving conflict.
