  <h2>Applying Hashes and Arrays to What I Do Everyday</h2>

    <p>Arrays and Hashes are really exciting for me. They were the point in my budding programming career when I fell in love with code. The ability to store lots of information and access it is really vital to the work I do everyday. My work in Black youth led justice movements has really been propelled by the ability to put phone numbers in an array and utilize the Twilio API to connect with activists to remind them about a protest or a meeting.</p> 
    <p>Additionally, before I am able to lobby the city to put eligibility requirements for social services in city, state, county open data portals, eligibility requirements for social services are stored in hashes for so they can easily inform people whether they qualify in the app I have been co-developing, <a href="http://www.mrelief.com/">mRelief</a>.</p>
    <p>So, what are these things?</p>
    <h3>Arrays</h3>
    <p> According to Chris Pine's <i>Learn to Program</i> arrays are a list in your computer wherein every slot in the list acts like a variable and you can see what object a particular slot points to. This great when you want to store things in a numerical order. The process of arrays usually start with assigning them to a variable You could also start out with an empty array and assign a slot. Here is an example I came up with on the fly:</p>
    <xmp>
	fyne_ass_rappers = [ ]
	fyne_ass_rappers [0] = Wale 
	fyne_ass_rappers [1] = Mack Wilds
	</xmp>
	<p>I could go on to list these until I came up with the top rappers for 2014. Other important things to call out about arrays, they start at 0, not 1 in terms of how they order information.</p>
	<h3>Hashes</h3>
	<p>Hashes, are defined at codecademy.com as a collection of key-value pairs. Hash syntax, code-speak for punctuation, looks like this:</p>
	<xmp>
   	hash = {
 	key1 => value1,
  	key2 => value2,
  	key3 => value3
	}
	</xmp>
	<p>
	Essentially, hashes are used to store pieces of information that wouldn't intuitively be listed in numerical order. This is just a brief post to get this concept across. As I continue to jot down my process coming into software development, I hope to delve even further with these concepts.
