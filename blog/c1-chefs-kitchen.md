The Culture of Dev BootCamp: On Jumping off the Cliff

10/20/14

Accountability. Ownership. Passion. These are the first words that comes to mind when I think about DBC and listen to the fireside chat. Accountability -- because DBC truly creates a space of accountability and checking in from GPS sessions to weekly deadlines. Ownership -- because what I learn depends on me. Passion because I can't jump off this cliff and have the grit to push through to the end unless I am really passionate about what being developer will help me create in the world. 

So far, I am really, really overwhelmed -- but in a good way. I definitely feel like I have jumped off of a cliff in trying to learn what feels so intricate and complex -- especially doing so on a Windows machine which has unexpected glitches.

DBC feels very thorough. I have had my share of higher education, this is the first place where I have studied where I have a good grasp of how I best learn and what I want my learning to apply to. And for that I am very grateful.

As far as the DBC culture, I feel like I am totally a cook in the code kitchen. I am not going to be a passive consumer of code. But at the same time, I am wondering how to manage competing interests -- my startup and learning how to code effectively. I believe that I have what it takes to perservere and to identify what I need to be successful in the educational arena and the startup arena.

I am grateful to be on this journey.
