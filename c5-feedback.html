    <p>I am still coming down from a Code High that I had with Darrin Reeves last week. It was somewhere in the middle of the Cipher challenge. We were pseudocoding and a fog was finally lifted. Darrin is a patient guy who has had more experience with computers and programming than I. Even though he can complete most of his challenges in 15 minutes, he soldiers through with me if something is unclear and he uses his knowledge -- and lightly tinged Jamaican accent -- to help me understand. The methods, the conditionals, the syntax and the structure started to make sense, and for that hour it was clear how one might approach a challenge like deciphering encrypted messages with Ruby code.</p>
   
    <p>Other moments have happened since then that remind me when I am in the thick of things that I am still dedicated to learn more code. In my spare time, I am a membership co-chair for BYP100, a Black youth organization headquartered on the South Side of Chicago. Through the genius of Twilio and my homegurl Ellie Day who helps sleuth out syntax errors, I deployed a mass text message to our GOTV lists using Ruby concepts such as an "array" (a list of items, in this case numbers) and the ".each" (a method that performs an action in each item in an array) method. I love doing real-world shit with code. I smile wide when my command line "puts "Sent message to #{number}" over and over and over. Because that means code works and it can work for an outcome I want to create. Sending texts may be some super simple code compared to making a Bingo game, but it is something that was not easily accessible before I learned Ruby.</p>
    
    <p>Feedback is also an important part of coding that I value. I love Guided Pairing Sessions. Sometimes my feedback has been a bummer when I have paired with people who have been significantly more advanced and it feels like I don't have as much to contribute. But next time I will prepare more in my quest of more code highs. I am happy to be growing and learning and most of all -- coding.<p>
