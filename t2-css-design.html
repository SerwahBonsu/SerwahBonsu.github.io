<p>Letâ€™s talk Cascading Style Sheets - CSS. CSS, according, to <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy</a> is a language used to describe the appearance and formatting of your HTML. 
CSS is important because it allows you to style your website in a more efficient way and with a sheet that can be applied to multiple different web pages.
</p>

<h4>Two CSS Selectors: ID and Class</h4>
<p>Classes come in handy  when you have a bunch of elements that should all receive the same styling. Classes are given to HTML elements with the word class and an equals sign, like so:</p>
<xmp>
<div class="square"></div>
</xmp>

<p>Classes are identified in CSS with a dot (.) like this.
IDs are useful when you have exactly one element that should receive a certain kind of styling. IDs are given to HTML elements with the word id and an equals sign:
</p>

<xmp>
<div id="first"></div>
</xmp>

<p>IDs are identified in CSS with a pound sign (#):
An <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/970730/css-id-vs-class">article</a> on stackoverflow makes this analogy about classes vs. ids to help understand which is used for one instance of something in an html document vs. many:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ID = Student ID (Schools don't issue identical IDs to multiple students)</li>
  <li>CLASS = Group of Students (Like 'The Biology Class' will be going on a fieldtrip)</li>
</ul>

<p>Happy CSSing!</p>
