    <p>Coding is a struggle. While I concede that it is totally learnable, external factors often have to be managed to facilitate a meaningful learning experience. The biggest challenge for me has been climbing the learning curve of Virtual Machines, which was the best chance I had to get my Windows system to be code-ready. I slowly learned that in the beginning, it can impact the way I download programs essential for programming, whether or not internet connectivity will be seemless, and the overall interface in which I field error messages. I was lucky to have a fellow cohort member mentor me through this process, and feel like I have hit my stride through tons of trial and error and the robust resources on Digital Ocean.</p>
    <p>After firefighting technical challenges, I also had to take some time to think about how my learning style affects the way I retain knowledge. I am a kinesthetic learner meaning I learn by doing. That means that going through repetitive exercises in codecademy or treehouse are much more effective for me to learn than finishing Pine chapters in one sitting. I struggle a lot with applying concepts after I have just read it once or have seen it in a video. I need to <b>do</b>. Do again. And do again. So this poses some time management challenges for me.  </p>
    <p>So, to be successful at DBC, I have had to flex my time management muscles and really be introspective about what helps me produce my best work. I learned a lot from the time management resources DBC personally offers and routinely have a timer tracking the length it takes for me to complete challenges. I have also invested in a co-working space that is affirming to ensure I am not couch-coding (which is a total slow-downer).</p>
    <p>I also have to consciously work on my attitude toward coding. I have had a tendency to view it as this larger than life thing that is as vast as the internet, so vast it <i>feels</i> unlearnable. I also excelled more in writing than math growing up, so sometimes I let that psych me out. I counteract this by reciting affirming poems and sayings on my caffeine runs. I recited this <a href="http://www.values.com/inspirational-quotes/6870-Promise-Yourself-To-Be-So-S-">one</a> 40 times today. I also have to take my thinking style into account. I am a Concrete Random Thinker: I am a brainstormer, self-directed, experimenter. It's most digestible for me to frame things I learn in the context of my own experiences.</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, I try to invoke a saying of a good friend of mine MJ: Always Learning. MJ's credo is consistent with the tenets of a “growth intelligence mindset,” one that seeks challenge and believes that failure is not a proof of unintelligence but an encouraging springboard for growth and development." So I am not beating myself up when I take too long to learn something. I am being proactive and really investing time in tracking how long things take so that next week and the week after -- I have better assessment of how long it is going to take ao I can allocate and cut accordingly.</p> 
    </p>Like, for instance this message was written to you in 30 minutes. How much you want to bet I could get this down to 20 by Phase 1?</p>
