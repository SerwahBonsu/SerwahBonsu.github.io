  <h1>In code -- unfortunately -- there is such a thing as asking a stupid question</h1>

  <p>So I really think this <a href="http://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/">piece</a>, "Writing the Perfect Question" nails it -- in that it sums up exactly what I need to be keeping in mind when I ask things online or perhaps in-person. I have been shut down on StackOverflow and Quora a time or two and it wasn't until I started to learn how to code that I learned why. Unfortunately in the world of code -- and particularly stack overflow -- there are such things as stupid questions. Below are some bullet points on avoiding getting permanently banned on the might Stack Overflow:  </p>  

        <ul>
          <li><b>Context Matters:</b> Always say the programming language you are referencing.</li>
          <li><b>Headlines Matter:</b> The abbreviated question is just as important as the unabridged version.</li>
          <li><b>Get to the Heart of One Question:</b> Sometimes people will ask multiple questions; one good question is ideal.</li>
         <li><b>Sample Code and Data</b> This is key to getting an applicable response and showing you have at least taken a whack at what you want others to help solve. Heaven helps those...</li>
        </ul>

  <p>In the end, it has been informative to get to the root of how I pose questions, as I suspect it has everything to do with the answers I need.</p>
